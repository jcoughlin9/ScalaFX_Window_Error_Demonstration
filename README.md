# ScalaFX_Window_Error_Demonstration
This script opens two ScalaFX windows a few seconds apart. If the first window is being dragged while the second opens, subsequent mouse clicks fail to register even outside this application.
Tested on Windows 10, Scala 2.11.7, ScalaFX 8.0.40-R8, and Java 8 update60.
